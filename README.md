**DOOM - Clone**

Inspired by the 1993 original by id software, developed using Java and modern OpenGL practises and scaled down to keep the look and feel of the original.


**Features**

Custom 3D-Engine, scaled down to 2.5 to mimic the original scaled up 2D Engine

Modern rendering pipeline using OpenGL VAO/VBO setup 

Simple GLSL shaders to ensure basic rendering while keeping resource costs low

JSON based map parser for plug for versatile map creation and selection

Raycasting collision-system for precise movement and bounds checks while keeping the "sliding" collision of the original game intact


**Tech Stack**

Java
LWJGL
OpenGL
GLSL
GSON
IntelliJ


**About this project**

While this project started for educational purposes, it evolved to a passion project and now represents both my love for the Doom series and my interest in learning game development.
My overall aim is to improve as a programmer while building a game that holds true to the original look and feel as best as I can.

**Developed independently by Paul Blume**
